# timesheet.rb

Simple ruby script for tracking work time. It can automatically count overtime and hours to make up taking into 
consideration such things as private exits and flexible start/end of work. Tested only on Windows 10 with ruby 2.2+.

In usage since 2016. TBC :)

**TODO**

* Refactor to OOP.
* Add Unit Tests.
* Enable YAML configuration instead of passing args as script parameters.
* GEM?
